# TODO

Goal: make a tool that helps people determine how bad things are at varoius
places around the world.

* Put a small graph/visualization in each button that you use to select a
  country
* Plot deaths and active cases together?
* Plot doubling lines?
* Allow user to select date range
* Instead of sorting by population, sort by number of new cases in the last 4-7
  days.
